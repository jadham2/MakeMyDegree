ECE General Education Requirement (17-18 credits)
While a comprehensive understanding of science and mathematics is central and foundational to effective engineering practice, real-world engineering problems are both complex and situated within dynamic social, political, and cultural contexts. Therefore, well-rounded engineering curricula must also include courses that encompass the breadth of human experience and culture, both past and present. Such courses may include, but are not limited to, those that explore individual behavior, social and political structures, aesthetic values, modes and dynamics of communication, philosophical and ethical thought, and cognitive processes. These types of courses provide engineering students with a framework for rational inquiry, critical evaluation, and judgment when dealing with issues that are non-quantifiable, ambiguous, and/or controversial. In addition, they offer engineering students the opportunity to develop interests and insights that will deepen their appreciation for the diversity of the world in which they live and work.
Based on these premises, the goals of the ECE General Education Program are to
Provide the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.
Support and complement the technical content of the engineering curricula through coursework that emphasizes such skills as written communication, oral communication, information literacy, cultural awareness, leadership, innovation, entrepreneurship, and managing change.
These goals are consistent with the objectives of the College of Engineering’s Engineer of 2020 initiative (Engineering Faculty Document 15-06), as well as the objectives of Purdue University’s Undergraduate Outcomes-Based Curriculum (University Senate Document 11-7).
To these ends, all B.S. students in Electrical and Computer Engineering are required to complete the ECE General Education Program described below. This program is consistent with the College of Engineering General Education Program (Engineering Faculty Documents 43-13 and 39-14).
-----------------------------
Foundational General Education Electives
Students must select from the list of courses approved by the University Curriculum Council (UCC) to satisfy each of the following six Foundational Learning Outcomes of the University Core Requirements - the Science and Quantitative Reasoning Foundational Outcomes are satisfied elsewhere in the BSCMPE curriculum. Some courses may have been approved to meet more than one of the Foundational Learning Outcomes, so fewer than six courses can be used to fulfill this condition. There is no minimum number of credit hours needed to satisfy this component of the College of Engineering General Education Program. If a course taken to fulfill some other EE/CMPE degree requirement has also been approved as satisfying one or more of these Engineering Foundational Learning Outcomes, then those Engineering Foundational Learning Outcomes need not be satisfied again within the ECE General Education Program. Students must earn a grade of C- or better in courses used to satisfy this component of the ECE General Education Program. The pertinent Foundational Learning Outcomes are defined as follows:
Written Communication (satisfied as an FYE requirement)
Oral Communication (satisfied as an FYE requirement)
Information Literacy
Human Cultures: Humanities
Human Cultures: Behavioral/Social Science
Science, Technology & Society
-----------------------------
ECE General Education Electives
Students must take additional approved courses to reach the minimum requirement of 17-18 credit hours (the minimum is 17 credits if a 4 credit hour Written Communication Foundational Core course is taken in the First Year). Other courses, as approved by the ECE Curriculum Committee, may also be selected. See Additional Degree Requirements below to see the list of approved courses.
-----------------------------
Advanced Level General Education Requirement
At least 6 of the 17-18 credit hours needed to satisfy the ECE General Education Requirement must come from courses at the 30000-level or above, or from courses with a required prerequisite in the same department.
-----------------------------
Educational Diversity Requirement
At least 12 credit hours of the 17-18 credit hours needed to satisfy the ECE General Education Requirement must be taken from the College of Liberal Arts, the Krannert School of Management, and/or the Honors College - provided such courses are not focused primarily on engineering, technology, the natural sciences, or mathematics. The subject areas associated with these colleges and school are:
College of Liberal Arts: AAS, AD, AMST, ANTH, ARAB, ASL, CHNS, CLCS, CMPL, COM, DANC, ENGL, FR, GER, GREK, HEBR, HIST, IDIS, ITAL, JPNS, JWST, LATN, LC, LING, MARS, MUS, PHIL, POL, PTGS, REL, RUSS, SOC, SPAN, THTR, WGSS
Krannert School of Management: ECON, ENTR, MGMT
Honors College: HONR
-----------------------------
Complementary Electives (up to 2 credits)
Choose additional coursework to bring total credits to the minimum 125 required for the BSCMPE degree. Students should carefully select these courses to complement their personal interests and their academic record.
All courses, except those specifically excluded by the ECE Curriculum Committee, may be used as Complementary Electives (See Additional Degree Requirements below to view list).

Notes
An overall GPA of 2.0 or higher in the Required Major Courses is required.
All 30000-level and above courses applied towards the Required Major Courses must be completed at the Purdue West Lafayette campus.
The pass/no pass (P/N) grade option, if available, may be used for courses taken to satisfy the ECE General Education and Complementary Elective Requirements. The P/N grade option cannot be used for courses applied towards the Required Major Courses, General Engineering Requirement, Mathematics Requirement, and the Science Requirement (unless P/N is the only allowed grade option for that course).
-----------------------------
Critical Course
The ♦ course is considered critical.
In alignment with the Degree Map Guidance for Indiana’s Public Colleges and Universities, published by the Commission for Higher Education (pursuant to HEA 1348-2013), a Critical Course is identified as “one that a student must be able to pass to persist and succeed in a particular major.  Students who want to be nurses, for example, should know that they are expected to be proficient in courses like biology in order to be successful.  These would be identified by the institutions for each degree program”. 
-----------------------------
Disclaimer
The student is ultimately responsible for knowing and completing all degree requirements.
